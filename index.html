        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            AWS offers a variety of remote servers. One of its most popular categories is the suite of EC2 T2 instances.
            Two of these instances are the Micro and the Large. The Micro has 1 vCPU, 1GiB of RAM, and a rate of 0.0166 USD
            per hour when running Linux. The large has 2 vCPUs, 8GiB of RAM, and a rate of 0.0928 USD per hour, or eight times
            that of the Micro. But is the extra vCPU and RAM worth the 800% cost increase when running a web server?

        <h2>Experimental Set Up</h2>
        <p>
            Apache HTTP 2.4.53 was installed on an AWS EC2 T2 Micro instance and an AWS EC2 T2 Large instance both 
            running Amazon Linux 2 x86 Kernel-5.10, SSD.
        </p>
        <p>
            To test the two instances for Apache performance when serving different content types, one HTML 
            file of size 143 bytes, one PHP file containing only the phpinfo() function that displays PHP config 
            information, and one JPEG of size 426 kbytes were placed in Apache's root directory on each instance
            to act as testing endpoints.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apache Bench (ab) was run using a third AWS EC2 T2 Micro instance running Apache HTTP 2.4.53
            on Amazon Linux 2 Kernel-5.10 as the request generating machine. A total of 10,000 requests
            were sent to each endpoint at a concurrency level of 1000. All three machines were part of the 
            same VPC. Requests per second and time to fulfill a request were measured.

            Figure 1 shows the requests per second (Fig. 1a) and time per request (Fig. 1b) that Apache was able to handle the requests
            on each instance.

            To visualize the passage of time as the concurrent requests were fulfilled, GNUPlot was used 
            to graph cumulative total time taken as requests were completed (Figure 2). The micro and large instances
            are virtually matched in terms of cumulative distribution and total time taken for all three content types.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            The requests per second and time per request graphs and cumulative time plots show that Apache performed 
            slightly faster on the large instance when handling PHP and serving JPEG files, but was in fact slower 
            on the large instance when serving HTML. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is difficult to say whether the differences in recorded metrics are significant. 
            Assuming the differences in performance for PHP and JPEG files are significant, it is hard to 
            conclude that the large instance is worth the 800% cost increase. A possible source of 
            bottlenecking lies with Apache. As the remote machines communicate with Apache to serve the 
            content, the machine may be limited by its computing power to make the connection with Apache 
            which may explain why the large instance was able to perform slightly better but ultimately 
            the system may have been limited overall by Apache's ability to fulfill the requests which is why 
            even though the large instance has double the vCPUs, a performance on the magnitude of being at 
            least two times better than the micro instance was not observed. Apache is known to be a bulky 
            piece of software with robust configuration capabilities and dynamic content processing which 
            may explain why it is a source of a bottleneck.
        </p>
        <p>
            AWS EC2 T2 offers micro and large instances as part of this line of remote machines. The large offers 
            double the vCPUs and 8 times the RAM, yet it doesn't seem to offer 8 times the performance that would 
            match its cost that is 8 times larger than the micro instance. For use cases similar to the ones imitated 
            in this experiment the micro instance seems to be enough to get the job done.
